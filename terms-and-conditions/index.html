            <h4>Introduction</h4>
            <p style="margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px">These terms govern any offer that you receive to sell your Product to or through Sphere. These terms, the terms that govern your use of Sphere's web sites ("Sphere Websites"), the Sphere Services and any and all applications included therein.
                You acknowledge that this Agreement is in electronic form and has the same force and effect as an agreement in writing. In this Agreement, the term "you" or "your" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this Agreement, and
                the term "Sphere," "we" or "us" means Sphere and its affiliates and subsidiaries.</p>

            <p style="margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px">BY USING SPHERE'S WEB SITES, YOU SIGNIFY THAT YOU AGREE TO THE FOLLOWING TERMS AND CONDITIONS, WHICH MAY BE AMENDED AT ANY TIME BY POSTING THE AMENDED TERMS ON THE SPHERE WEBSITES. ANY AMENDED TERMS WILL BE AUTOMATICALLY EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY
                AFTER THEY ARE POSTED. Sphere reserves the right to terminate or suspend your use of the Sphere Websites and/or the Sphere Services if you do not comply with this Agreement or any other Sphere policy or procedure, or for any other reason
                we determine, in our sole discretion.</p>

            <p style="margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px">Sphere Buyback ("Sphere") offers services (the "Sphere Services") through which you can sell certain consumer electronic products (the "Products") after receiving an "offer" from Sphere by identifying your Product and completing check-out
                on the Sphere Websites. You must agree to abide by the following terms in order to use the Sphere Services and/or the Sphere Websites.</p>

            <h4>Requirements</h4>
            <p style="margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px">In order to complete the sale of your Product to or through Sphere or to complete any other transaction with Sphere, you must:
                <ol>
                    <li>Provide true, up to date and accurate account information about yourself and any Product you submit to us</li>
                    <li>Comply with all terms and conditions of this Agreement</li>
                    <li>Comply with all applicable laws and regulations</li>
                    <li>Transact on behalf of yourself and not on behalf of others</li>
                    <li>Have the legal capacity to enter into agreements and to convey title and interest in any Product that you submit to us</li>
                </ol>
                In order to receive payments for any Products we purchase from you, you must provide us with information including a valid email address at which you are able to receive email, a valid postal address at which you are able to receive mail, and your first
                and last name. Sphere shall not be responsible for communication errors should your contact information be in accurate or incomplete. You are responsible for ensuring that you can receive emails from Sphere and Sphere is not responsible
                for any emails that were not received by you because they were blocked or filtered as spam. You understand and agree that if you fail to provide us with accurate and up to date information about yourself; we will not be responsible for any misapplied payments or payments sent to a wrong address, and any unclaimed funds may be subject to collection by governmental authorities under applicable unclaimed funds and escheat laws. You agree that we have no obligation to you if any of your unclaimed funds are turned over to governmental authorities.</p>

            <h4>Product Eligibility</h4>
            <p style="margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px"> Sphere determines, in its sole discretion, which Products are eligible for purchase by or through the Sphere Services and for which eligible Products Sphere will provide an offer. Sphere may terminate the eligibility of certain Products at
                any time and without advanced notice, but such termination will not affect any Products for which you have already accepted an offer, which is good for thirty (30) days.</p>

            <h4>Condition Defined</h4>
            <p style="margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px"> Sphere uses four (4) basic Product conditions to grade Products, ranging from "Mint" to "Broken." Exact Condition determined by Sphere can vary according to the individual Product. Broadly, Sphere's Product definitions are as follows:

                <ul style="list-style-type:none">
                    <li><b>Mint</b>: the item looks like it has never been used and is 100% functional</li>
                    <li><b>Good or Rough</b>: the item has visible signs of use, but is otherwise 100% functional</li>
                    <li><b>Broken</b>: the item does not turn on, one or more Product functions is non-operative or the item has serious physical damage that inhibits use (e.g. broken or cracked screen or missing parts)</li>
                </ul>

                The above definitions are broad guidelines. More specific condition definitions specific to the category and/or type of Product may be included on the Sphere Website offer screen and serve as the effective condition definition for that product. Condition
                definitions are subject to change at Sphere's discretion. In the case where you are unsure of the condition of the Product you are engaing Sphere Services with, you are advised to contact Sphere through appropriate chanels.</p>

            <h4>Product Valuation</h4>
            <p style="margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px"> All offers will be based on Sphere's own determination of the Product value in reliance on the accuracy of the information you supply us. Sphere will use its discretion to determine the Product value, weighing factors that may include the
                Product's model, functionality and condition and whether necessary Product accessories have been provided by you. Upon receiving an offer, you have the option of accepting or rejecting that offer. Acceptance indicates you are willing to
                provide your Product to Sphere at the offered price. If you do not accept Sphere's offer, the specific transaction expires. If after rejecting the offer you change your mind and want to accept the offer, you will need to open another transaction
                with us at which point, assuming the Product is still eligible for purchase, the new offer may be different as Product prices are subject to change.</p>

            <h4>Fitness of Sale; Phone and Internet Service</h4>
            <p style="margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px"> You must have all right, title, and interest in any and all Products you seek to sell to Sphere and all Products must be able to be activated for new service (unless the Product is incapable of being activated because it is in "Broken" condition).
                The Products and the sale and shipment of such items to Sphere must comply with all the following conditions:
                <ol>
                    <li>Must comply with all applicable laws, statutes, and ordinances</li>
                    <li>May not infringe on third party intellectual property rights (including copyrights, trademarks, patents, trade secrets or other proprietary rights)</li>
                    <li>Shall not be counterfeit, stolen, or fraudulent. You represent and warrant that the Products are free of any liens or encumbrances, including third-party software which may not be transferred or for which royalties are due</li>
                </ol>
                By using Sphere Services, you agree to indemnify Sphere from all claims or losses sustained by Sphere as a result of any breach of these representations and warranties. It is your responsibility to discontinue phone, Internet and/or any similar service
                on your Product prior to selling it to Sphere. Sphere is not responsible for any service charges related to your Product, whether you incur such charges before, during or after your use of the Services. It is also your responsibility to
                remove any security codes that would prevent use of any Product.</p>

            <h4>Data Removal</h4>
            <p style="margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px">For Products involving devices that store files and/or personal data on hard drives, memory cards or the like, you must back up and store any data you wish to keep from your Product and remove any personal information before you send your
                Product to us. Sphere's standard practice is to remove all such data from your Product; however Sphere makes no guarantee that it will do so. By sending Sphere your Product, you agree to release us from any claim as to the Product, the
                data stored in such Product, or any information on any media used in conjunction with the Product and which you send to Sphere, or for such data's security, integrity, confidentiality, disclosure or use. Sphere is not responsible for any
                loss suffered by you due to any data that is not erased from the device and transferred to a third party, or any loss of data after you submitted your Product to us.</p>

            <h4>Sending Sphere Your Product</h4>
            <p style="margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px">Sending us a Product which does not match your original description, may impact the final value of your Product and may result in a revised offer as further detailed in the following article.</p>

            <h4>Product Inspection and Offer Recalculation</h4>
            <p style="margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px"> Your Product must be received by Sphere within thirty (30) days after you accept the original offer provided by Sphere and complete the check-out process on the Sphere Website (the "Delivery Period") or the offer shall automatically expire.
                Packing and shipping recommendations provided to you by Sphere should be followed in order to avoid possible damage to or loss of the Product in transit. Sphere will inspect all Products that are received. Sphere has the option to accept
                or reject the Product, including without limitation, to reject any Product not conforming to the description you provided to us, any Product modified in such a way that it no longer conforms to the original factory specifications, any
                Product no longer complying with applicable laws or regulations (e.g., FCC rules, etc.) and/or any Product damaged or lost in transit. If Sphere rejects the Product for any of these reasons, the original offer automatically expires and
                is rescinded. Sphere reserves the right to revoke the original offer and provide a revised offer for the Product due to any of the following conditions:
                <ol>
                    <li>Product and/or materials are not as described</li>
                    <li>Product is received by Sphere after the Delivery Period</li>
                    <li>Sphere receives Product(s) that are different from those identified when your offer was calculated</li>
                </ol>
            </p>

            <h4>Recalculated Product Offers Post Inspection.</h4>
            <p style="margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px">In the event Sphere recalculates the offer it provided for the Product after it has been received and inspected, as described above, you shall have the option of accepting or rejecting the new offer. If you accept the new offer, you will be
                paid in normal course and in accordance with these service terms. If you reject the new offer, Sphere will return the Product to you at the address from which it was originally sent. Sphere will give you a period of five (5) days after
                Sphere presents you with a recalculated offer via email at the address you provided to accept or reject the new offer (the "New Offer Period"). Sphere will also remind you of the outstanding new offer one or more times during the New Offer
                Period. However, if the new offer is neither affirmatively accepted nor rejected by you during the New Offer Period, the new offer will be deemed to have been accepted by you and you will be paid the new offer price in the normal course
                and in accordance with these service terms. For the avoidance of doubt, your acceptance of the original offer and/or any new offer is final and you may not change your decision about accepting such offer at a later date.</p>

            <h4>Releasing Rights to Product</h4>
            <p style="margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px">Once you send Sphere your Product, Sphere cannot and does not guarantee that it will be able to honor any request for return of the Product and/or any data or information contained in such Product, unless a new offer is rejected within the
                New Offer Period.</p>

            <h4>Risk Of Loss</h4>
            <p style="margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px">You remain responsible for the risk of loss for the Products until delivery of the same to Sphere. You are responsible for any damages that may occur to your Product while in transit. Sphere is responsible for risk of loss when it opens the
                packaging containing your Product and ceases in the event Sphere returns your product to you for any reason. For the avoidance of doubt, in such event, risk of loss will be transferred to you once Sphere delivers the package to the carrier
                for return to you and you will bear the risk of loss while the Product is in transit.</p>

            <h4>Passing of Title</h4>
            <p style="margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px">Title to the applicable Product passes to Sphere upon Sphere's acceptance of the Product for the original offer or the new offer, as applicable. If there is a Return Circumstance, title shall not pass and shall remain with you.</p>

            <h4>Non-Transferable</h4>
            <p style="margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px">Any offer by Sphere for your Product is non- transferable and not redeemable for any other consideration other than what is offered by Sphere.</p>

            <h4>Promotions</h4>
            <p style="margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px">From time to time, and at Sphere's sole discretion, Sphere may offer promotional programs as an incentive to customers. Promotions applicable to payments are applied as an increment to the final value of a customer's Product, but they are
                not considered a change in that final value. Promotional programs have explicitly defined terms, including but not limited to, expiration, usage per person and per transaction, and other limitations and restrictions. All promotion codes
                may only be applied once per person. Unless otherwise stated, promotions must be applied by you before checkout. For the avoidance of doubt, once checkout is completed, promotions cannot be applied to the same transaction. Sphere reserves
                the right, in its sole discretion, to cancel or refuse promotions.</p>

            <h4>Accuracy of all Information</h4>
            <p style="margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px">Sphere makes every effort to ensure the accuracy of all information you receive in relation to your Product. From time to time, however, there may be typographical errors, technical inaccuracies, pricing or other errors or omissions. As such,
                Sphere reserves the right, at any time prior to payment, to Correct an error and/or Change the offer. In the event the Product has already been sent to Sphere, the changed offer will become a New Offer. Otherwise, the changed offer will
                be a re-issued original offer, which you may accept or reject, or Void a transaction. If the Product was already sent to Sphere, Sphere will be deemed to have rejected the Product resulting in a Return Circumstance.</p>
            <h4>Privacy</h4>
            <p style="margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px">We view protection of users' privacy as a very important community principle. When you use the Sphere Web Sites and the Sphere Services, we collect information about you. You agree that we may collect and use your information in accordance
